# Loopwise

## Inspiration

The idea for Loopwise came from seeing the challenges rideshare drivers face while looking for passengers. Drivers often spend significant time idling or driving around aimlessly, leading to lost earnings and wasted fuel. Inspired by traffic heatmaps and optimized delivery routes, we wanted to build a tool that would give drivers actionable insights, showing them where passengers are most likely to need rides. Our goal was to help drivers maximize their efficiency and earnings while minimizing unnecessary driving.

## What it does

Loopwise leverages real-time GPS data and historical demand trends to provide rideshare drivers with optimized driving loops, guiding them to high-demand areas at peak times. By following these suggested routes, drivers can increase their chances of picking up passengers without needing to hunt for rides. Loopwise updates routes based on current demand, helping drivers stay in the most profitable areas at all times.

## How we built it

We built Loopwise using a combination of Python for data processing, machine learning for demand prediction, and a frontend to visualize route suggestions. Here's a breakdown of our tech stack and approach:

- **Data Processing:** We processed GPS and historical ride data to identify high-demand locations at various times of day using Python libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, `folium`, and `matplotlib` (including `basemap`, `colors`, `pyplot`, `leaflet`).
- **Machine Learning:** Implemented a recommendation algorithm using DBSCAN Clustering and LSTM Time Series models to suggest loops that place drivers in high-demand areas efficiently.
- **Frontend:** A React-based user interface that enables drivers to view their personalized route suggestions in real time.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the biggest challenges we faced was managing and processing large datasets of GPS and ride data in real time. Here’s a summary of the difficulties we encountered:

1. **Data Collection:** Finding the right datasets that had all the features we needed was challenging. We used multiple datasets before zeroing in on the most useful one.
2. **Algorithm Tuning:** Ensuring that the route recommendations were always relevant to current demand patterns required continuously updating our algorithms.
3. **Efficiency vs. Practicality:** Making sure that the route suggestions were not only accurate but also easy for drivers to follow. Balancing this was crucial for the usability of the application.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- We successfully created a system that processes large-scale GPS data efficiently.
- Our machine learning model accurately predicts high-demand areas and provides real-time routing guidance.
- We’ve helped drivers save time and earn more by reducing idle periods, which is a huge achievement for the team.

## What we learned

- **GPS Data Processing:** We gained a deeper understanding of processing large volumes of GPS data and predicting demand.
- **Route Optimization:** We explored various algorithms for pathfinding and loop recommendations, focusing on real-world practicality.
- **Data Cleaning:** Working with real-world data taught us the importance of cleaning and smoothing data to ensure accuracy in predictions.

## What's next for Loopwise

- **Adaptive Learning:** We plan to enhance Loopwise with reinforcement learning that adapts to the driver's usage patterns and feedback.
- **Event & Weather Data Integration:** We are exploring integrating weather and event data into our predictions for smarter recommendations.
- **Expanding Use Cases:** We aim to extend Loopwise beyond rideshare services to help delivery drivers and other mobile professionals optimize their routes.
